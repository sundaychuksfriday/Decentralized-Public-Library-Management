# Decentralized Public Library Management System

A blockchain-based platform for modernizing public library operations through decentralized record-keeping, transparent lending processes, and data-driven acquisitions.

## Overview

This system leverages blockchain technology to create an efficient, transparent, and interconnected public library ecosystem. By decentralizing library management, it enables seamless borrowing experiences across institutions, reduces administrative overhead, and provides valuable insights for collection development—all while maintaining patron privacy and data security.

## Core Smart Contracts

### Book Registration Contract

This contract maintains a comprehensive catalog of all library materials across participating institutions.

**Features:**
- Unique digital identifier for each physical item
- Complete bibliographic metadata storage
- Condition tracking and maintenance history
- Ownership verification and transfer capabilities
- Media type classification (books, audiobooks, DVDs, equipment, etc.)
- Special collection tagging and restrictions
- Author and publisher verification
- Integration with ISBN and standardized cataloging systems

### Borrowing Contract

This contract facilitates and tracks the lending and return processes.

**Features:**
- Patron identity verification (privacy-preserving)
- Check-out/check-in transaction logging
- Due date management and automatic renewal options
- Late fee calculation and payment processing
- Reservation and hold queue management
- Lending history for patrons (with privacy controls)
- Special borrowing privileges management
- Self-service checkout integration

### Inter-library Loan Contract

This contract coordinates the sharing of materials between different library systems.

**Features:**
- Cross-library search functionality
- Standardized request protocol
- Transportation and logistics tracking
- Cost-sharing calculations
- Priority management for requests
- Return verification system
- Performance metrics for participating libraries
- Service level agreement enforcement

### Usage Analytics Contract

This contract collects and analyzes anonymized usage data to inform acquisition decisions.

**Features:**
- Anonymous circulation statistics
- Popularity trends analysis
- Demographic interest patterns (privacy-preserving)
- Collection gap identification
- Demand forecasting for new acquisitions
- Budget allocation optimization
- Shelf-time vs. circulation-time analysis
- Comparative analysis across library systems

## Benefits

- **Efficiency**: Streamlined processes reduce administrative workload
- **Transparency**: Clear records of all transactions and material movements
- **Connectivity**: Seamless sharing between previously isolated library systems
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Smart acquisition based on actual usage patterns
- **Patron Experience**: Improved access to materials regardless of home library
- **Resource Optimization**: Better utilization of existing collections through sharing
- **Fraud Reduction**: Immutable record-keeping prevents manipulation of lending records

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ethereum-compatible blockchain access
- Node.js and npm
- IPFS node (for metadata storage)
- Library ILS integration adapters

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/decentralized-library-system.git
   cd decentralized-library-system
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your settings
   ```

4. Deploy smart contracts:
   ```
   truffle migrate --network [network_name]
   ```

5. Initialize the system:
   ```
   npm run initialize -- --admin-address [your_admin_address]
   ```

## User Roles

### Library Administrators
- Manage system configuration
- Set lending policies
- Approve inter-library loan partnerships

### Librarians
- Register new materials
- Process complex lending cases
- Generate analytics reports
- Manage collection development

### Library Patrons
- Search across all participating libraries
- Borrow materials from any participating location
- Track borrowing history
- Request inter-library loans

### System Governors
- Representatives from participating libraries
- Vote on protocol upgrades
- Approve new library participants
- Review system performance

## Implementation Considerations

### Privacy and Security
- All patron data is stored with privacy-preserving techniques
- Personal information is kept off-chain with secure references
- Reading history is anonymized for analytics
- Multi-signature authorization for sensitive operations

### Integration Capabilities
- APIs for existing Integrated Library Systems (ILS)
- Support for MARC21, Dublin Core, and other metadata standards
